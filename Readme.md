# VAE (TensorFlow)

![VAE-model](./images/VAE-model.png)

An implementation of VAE language generation model. Refer to the following paper for more details:

Bowman, S., Vilnis, L., Vinyals, O., Dai, A., Jozefowicz, R., and Bengio, S. Generating sentences from a continuous space. In *Proceedings of the Twentieth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning*, 2016.



## Require Packages

- cotk
- TensorFlow == 1.13.1
- TensorBoardX >= 1.4



## Quick Start

- Downloading dataset and save it to ``./data``. (Dataset will be released soon.)
- Execute ``python run.py`` to train the model.
  - The default dataset is ``MSCOCO``. You can use ``--dataset`` to specify other ``dataloader`` class.
  - It use `gloves`  pretrained word vector by default setting. You can use ``--wvclass`` to specify ``wordvector`` class.
  - If you don't have GPUs, you can add `--cpu` for switching to CPU, but it may cost very long time.
- You can view training process by tensorboard, the log is at `./tensorboard`.
  - For example, ``tensorboard --logdir=./tensorboard``. (You have to install tensorboard first.)
- After training, execute  ``python run.py --mode test --restore best`` for test.
  - You can use ``--restore filename`` to specify checkpoints files, which are in ``./model``.
  - ``--restore last`` means last checkpoint, ``--restore best`` means best checkpoints on dev.
- Find results at ``./output``.



## Arguments

```none
    usage: run.py [-h] [--name NAME] [--restore RESTORE] [--mode MODE]
                  [--dataset DATASET] [--datapath DATAPATH] [--epoch EPOCH]
                  [--wvclass WVCLASS] [--wvpath WVPATH] [--out_dir OUT_DIR]
                  [--log_dir LOG_DIR] [--model_dir MODEL_DIR]
                  [--cache_dir CACHE_DIR] [--cpu] [--debug] [--cache]


    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --name NAME           The name of your model, used for variable scope and
                            tensorboard, etc. Default: runXXXXXX_XXXXXX
                            (initialized by current time)
      --restore RESTORE     Checkpoints name to load. "last" for last checkpoints,
                            "best" for best checkpoints on dev. Attention: "last"
                            and "best" wiil cause unexpected behaviour when run 2
                            models in the same dir at the same time. Default: None
                            (dont load anything)
      --mode MODE           "train" or "test". Default: train
      --dataset DATASET     Dataloader class. Default: MSCOCO
      --datapath DATAPATH   Directory for data set. Default: ./data
      --epoch EPOCH         Epoch for trainning. Default: 10
      --wvclass WVCLASS     Wordvector class, None for using Glove pretrained
                            wordvec. Default: None
      --wvpath WVPATH       Path for pretrained wordvector. Default: wordvec
      --out_dir OUT_DIR     Output directory for test output. Default: ./output
      --log_dir LOG_DIR     Log directory for tensorboard. Default: ./tensorboard
      --model_dir MODEL_DIR
                            Checkpoints directory for model. Default: ./model
      --cache_dir CACHE_DIR
                            Checkpoints directory for cache. Default: ./cache
      --cpu                 Use cpu.
      --debug               Enter debug mode (using ptvsd).
      --cache               Use cache for speeding up load data and wordvec. (It
                            may cause problems when you switch dataset.)
```

For hyperparameter settings, please refer to `run.py`.


## TensorBoard Example

Execute ``tensorboard --logdir=./tensorboard``, you will see the plot in tensorboard pages:

Following plot are shown in this model:

- loss: reconstruction loss + kl loss.

  ![loss](./images/loss.png)

- perplexity: reconstruction perplexity.

  ![perplexity](./images/perplexity.png)

- kl_loss: kl_weight * min(kld, min_kl=10).

  ![kl_loss](./images/kl_loss.png)

- kld: kl divergence.

  ![kld](./images/kld.png)

- kl_weight: weight to the kl loss in the loss function.

Following text are shown in this model:

## Case Study of Model Results

Execute ``python run.py --mode test --restore last``

The following output will be in `./output/[name]_test.txt`:

```none
